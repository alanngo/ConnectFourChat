*[DONE]need to change turn() and printresults();mostly parameter call
*change intro to include instructions for chat
*[DONE]change all methods to not have scanner and not have parameter board, or scanner
**[Mostly DONE]rewrite getInt() and turn() based on how the server and client will be handled for a turn
(symbol: column number input)
** : send board as a message and on other side will need toupdate their board
*client/server
*have client be able to have a name


on client and server: need two modes (1 host, 2 host)
if 2 host:
when you send a message: check if it's a turn
on your side: update board.
on their side: they'll receive a message, check ifit's a choice, update their board.

if 1 host:
when 1 side inputs somethine, update board then
when other side receives their choice, don't do anything
